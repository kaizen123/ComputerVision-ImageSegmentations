# ComputerVision-ImageSegmentations
Image segmentation into foreground and background via clustering


Problem statement:
Use a bank of texture filters along with a clustering algorithm, to segment an image into foreground and background regions. The foreground region will then be extracted from the original image and placed in a separate background image. 
As an application of this technique, transfer an animal from one image to another.

Matlab code:
Uplaod all files in the same Matlab project.
Specify the path to the input image in run_me.m file
